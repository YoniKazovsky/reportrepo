## Author  
**Your Name**  

## Summary  
This investigation explores the evolution of type systems in programming languages, their impact on software development, and the researchers who shaped the field.

## Key Findings  

### Historical Developments  
- Early programming languages (e.g., ALGOL, Fortran) lacked robust type systems.
- The introduction of ML (1970s) introduced the concept of type inference, revolutionizing static type systems.
- In modern programming, gradual typing (e.g., TypeScript, Python) bridges static and dynamic typing.

### Subfields of PL and Interactions  
- **Type Theory:** Provided foundational concepts like lambda calculus and polymorphism.  
- **Formal Methods:** Ensured type systems are sound and reliable, influencing languages like Haskell.  
- **Programming Language Design:** Integrated user-friendly type systems in modern languages like Rust and Swift.  

### Influential Researchers  
- **Robin Milner:** Introduced type inference and the Hindley-Milner type system.  
- **Benjamin C. Pierce:** Authored *Types and Programming Languages*, a key reference.
