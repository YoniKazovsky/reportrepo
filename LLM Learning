Initial Question: How can recursion be used in the development of a programming language?
Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, used both in programming paradigms and in the theoretical foundation of computation. The exploration of recursion's role in programming language development opens up various areas of inquiry, from its influence on language syntax and semantics to its impact on compiler design and optimization. Using an LLM to dig deeper, I explored the historical significance of recursion, how it has been utilized in language design, and how different subfields of programming languages have contributed to understanding and leveraging recursion.

Historical Development of Recursion in Programming Languages
Recursion has long been a central idea in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. The idea of self-referential definitions emerged in the 1930s with Alonzo Church's lambda calculus, a formal system that could describe recursive functions. This theoretical groundwork set the stage for recursion to become a natural part of early programming languages, such as LISP in the 1950s.

In LISP, recursion was embraced as a core construct due to its alignment with the languageâ€™s functional paradigm and symbolic manipulation goals. As programming languages evolved, recursion became a crucial tool for solving problems where iterative approaches were less elegant or harder to express. Modern languages, including Haskell, Python, and Scala, still rely on recursion as a key tool for expressing complex algorithms.

Subfields of Programming Languages Contributing to Recursion
Theory of Computation:

The study of recursive functions is rooted in the Theory of Computation. Recursion is used to model any computable function, which demonstrates its power and flexibility in theoretical models such as Turing machines and lambda calculus.
Functional Programming:

In functional programming, recursion is the primary mechanism for iteration and repetition. Languages like Haskell and LISP deeply integrate recursion into their syntax and semantics. Functional programming research has explored how recursion enables elegant solutions to problems like parsing, tree traversal, and infinite data structures.
Type Theory:

Type theory, especially in dependent type systems (like those in Agda and Coq), leverages recursion heavily. Recursive data types, such as lists and trees, are defined in terms of themselves. Researchers in type theory have studied how recursion can be constrained and optimized to ensure programs terminate correctly.
Compiler Design and Optimization:

The field of compiler design has focused on optimizing recursive calls through techniques like tail-call optimization (TCO). This optimization allows recursive functions to execute in constant stack space, making recursion a practical tool for building efficient programs. Compilers for languages like Scheme and Scala implement TCO to improve the performance of recursive functions.
Influence Between Subfields
The theoretical study of recursion in lambda calculus has profoundly influenced the development of functional programming languages. The elegance of recursion in modeling computation in lambda calculus was translated directly into the syntax of languages like LISP, which further inspired later functional languages like ML and Haskell. The use of recursion in functional programming, in turn, has driven research in compiler optimization, where tail-call optimization was developed to make recursion feasible in real-world applications. Type theory also borrows from the recursive function theories of lambda calculus to define recursive data types and prove the correctness of programs that use recursion.

Influential Researchers
Alonzo Church: Developed lambda calculus, the theoretical foundation that formalized recursive functions.
John McCarthy: Designed LISP, one of the earliest programming languages that embraced recursion as a core concept.
Peter Landin: Contributed to the understanding of recursion and functional programming through his work on lambda calculus and its practical applications.
Robin Milner: Developed ML and contributed to type theory and recursion in programming languages.
Guy Steele: Worked on the design of Scheme, which pioneered tail-call optimization to support recursion.
Influential Works
"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine" by John McCarthy (1960): This paper introduced recursion in the context of LISP and showed how it could be used to manipulate symbolic expressions.
"The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics" by Henk Barendregt (1981): This work explores recursion through the lens of lambda calculus and how it forms the basis of functional languages.
"A Tail-Recursive Machine" by Gerald J. Sussman and Guy L. Steele Jr. (1975): Introduced the concept of tail-call optimization in the Scheme language, making recursion efficient.
"Compiling with Continuations" by Andrew Appel (1992): This book deals with compiler techniques, including tail-call optimization, that make recursion practical for real-world software development.
Conclusion
Recursion is not only a powerful programming technique but also a foundational concept that has shaped the design of modern programming languages. Through the fields of theory of computation, functional programming, type theory, and compiler design, recursion has become integral to both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of programming languages. Influential figures like Church, McCarthy, and Steele have left a lasting impact on how recursion is applied and optimized in programming. The research into recursion continues to evolve, particularly in areas such as type theory and compiler optimization, ensuring that it remains a key topic in programming language development.
